As Keith works towards building his career, he recognised that he lacked skills that are essential in areas he has strong interests: *investment product analyses* and *quantitative finance*. Therefore, in Summer 2020, he decided to take the initiative to learn Python. Together with his programming experience with Excel VBA and MySQL, he completed a Specialisation on Coursera: <ins>Applied Data Science with Python by University of Michigan</ins> (courtersy of his enrolled university). 

Throughout that summer, he spent time working on creating backtesting models for various technical trading strategies (ie. MA Crossovers). He also practiced training machine learning models in Python using publicly-available datasets (ie. UCI Machine Learning Repository). 

With the new skill he gained, he decided to work on his first "big" project: To build a machine learning model, coupled with text mining and sentiment analysis techniques, that predicts the percentage change of a stock market reflected by an index (ie. STI) on D+1, based on news released on D. On 19th July 2020, he published his first version of this project here on GitHub. The results were better than expected, however it is too early to celebrate as he only had limited data for use. He will continue to work and fine tune the project. 

The notebooks hosted in this repository are free for all to reference. Data that are not publicly available will not be used, and all sources of data are cited in the Jupyter notebook itself. Please feel free to contact Keith at [kwee006@e.ntu.edu.sg] if you have any comments or feedback with regards to this repository or any of his work.
